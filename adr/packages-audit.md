# Security Standards for Project Dependencies
This document outlines the security measures that are taken to ensure all project dependencies comply with security standards and are free from zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Audit Summary

### Vulnerabilities Found
- **7 vulnerabilities** (1 low, 6 moderate)
  - **Packages affected**:
    - `esbuild` (<=0.24.2)
    - `http-proxy-middleware` (1.3.0 - 2.0.8)
    - `webpack-dev-server` (<=5.2.0)

### Actions Taken
1. **Audit Command**:
  - Ran `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities.
  - Generated detailed JSON report using `npm audit --json` for further analysis.

2. **Fix Attempt**:
  - Ran `npm audit fix` to resolve automatically fixable issues.
  - Attempted `npm audit fix --force` but identified breaking changes with `@angular-devkit/build-angular@19.2.15`.

3. **Manual Review**:
  - Reviewed advisories for each affected package:
    - `esbuild`: Vulnerability allows websites to send requests to the development server and read responses. Advisory: [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99).
    - `http-proxy-middleware`: Moderate severity issues related to proxy handling.
    - `webpack-dev-server`: Moderate severity issues related to development server security.

## Packages Replacement

### Objective
The goal is to update the project to the latest Angular version to ensure compliance with security standards and to address vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies.

### Migration Steps
1. **Pre-Migration Analysis**: Verify the current Angular version, review breaking changes using the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/), and audit dependencies with `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities.
2. **Update Angular Packages**: Upgrade Angular CLI and core dependencies using `ng update @angular/core @angular/cli`. Ensure compatibility of third-party libraries and update TypeScript to match Angular's requirements.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Re-audit dependencies post-update and set up automated monitoring tools like `Snyk` or `npm audit` in CI/CD pipelines.

### Future Maintenance
Regularly update Angular and dependencies to stay secure, monitor security advisories, and refactor code to leverage new Angular features for improved security and performance. Ensure continuous testing and verification to maintain functionality and reliability.

## Verification

1. **Re-audit**:
  - Ran `npm audit` after replacements to ensure no vulnerabilities remain.
  - Confirmed zero vulnerabilities in the updated dependency tree.

2**Monitoring**:
  - Set up automated dependency monitoring using `Snyk` to detect future vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
All dependencies are updated or replaced to meet security standards. The project is free from known vulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities, as verified by the latest audit and manual review.
